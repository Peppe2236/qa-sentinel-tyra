# QA Sentinel Tyra Roadmap

## Current state

QA Sentinel Tyra has completed both the **Milestone 5 Quality Intelligence Framework** and the **Milestone 6 Advisory Autonomous QA Framework**.

Earlier foundations — Playwright reporting, Deep Discovery, actionable issue consolidation and the Quality Command Center — provide the evidence consumed by these frameworks.

## Decision authority and safety boundaries

- Unified Decisioning is the canonical release authority for dashboard schema v5.
- `releaseDecisionSource: 'unified-v5'` identifies the canonical decision path.
- The legacy release assessment remains available only as comparison telemetry.
- Autonomous QA is advisory-only: execution, remediation authorization and automatic release-decision updates remain disabled.
- Existing Unified Decision, P0–P4 priority and evidence semantics are reused; no competing weighted score is introduced.

## Milestone 5 – Quality Intelligence Framework ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed: 2026-08-13**

| Delivery | Completed capability |
|---|---|
| 5.1 Quality Intelligence Foundation | Shared evidence, assessment and quality-dimension foundation |
| 5.2 Requirements & Functionality Intelligence | Requirement and acceptance-criteria coverage intelligence |
| 5.3 Critical Flows Intelligence | Critical-flow and scenario coverage intelligence |
| 5.4 UX/UI Intelligence | User-experience and interface quality assessment |
| 5.5 Security & Performance Intelligence | Security and performance assessment |
| 5.6 Compatibility Intelligence | Browser, profile and compatibility assessment |
| 5.7 API & Backend Intelligence | API and backend issue intelligence |
| 5.8 Cross-layer Correlation | Evidence correlation across quality layers |
| 5.9 Unified Scoring & Decisioning | Canonical schema-v5 release assessment |

Unified Decisioning is the canonical schema-v5 release authority. Legacy release assessment remains available as comparison telemetry.

**Milestone 5:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Milestone 6 – Advisory Autonomous QA Framework ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed: 2026-08-17**

| Delivery | Completed advisory capability |
|---|---|
| 6.1 Advisory Autonomous QA Foundation | Advisory assessment, provenance and candidate-action model |
| 6.2 Risk-based Test Selection | Logical-test candidates based on existing risk, Unified Decision and provenance |
| 6.3 Advisory Execution Planning | Ordered phases and advisory test steps; execution remains disabled |
| 6.4 Advisory Failure Reproduction | Evidence-linked reproduction recipes for failed current-run tests |
| 6.5 Advisory Verification Planning | Verification plans remain `awaiting-new-evidence` |
| 6.6 Advisory Change Impact Analysis | Potential change impact without claiming confirmation |
| 6.7 Advisory Quality Drift Comparison | Pairwise comparison with the latest prior canonical schema-v5 run; `no-baseline` when unavailable |
| 6.8 Advisory Investigation Planning | Investigation cases and unconfirmed hypotheses for changed or potential-regression signals |

### Milestone 6 safety contract

- `executionEnabled: false`
- advisory actions and plans use `executable: false`
- analyzers launch no Playwright tests or shell commands
- remediation is not authorized or applied
- release decisions are not automatically updated
- verification requires new evidence
- potential impact, drift and root cause remain unconfirmed

**Milestone 6:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Next milestone

The next numbered milestone is intentionally **not yet defined**. Its scope, authority and safety boundaries should be documented here before implementation begins.
